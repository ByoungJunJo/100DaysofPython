100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021 (by Dr. Angela Yu) on Udemy

## Why Programming Again? (My journey to become a hacker)

It was a humble beginning.

I started programming when I was a Republic of Korea (ROK) Marine serving on the frontline of S.Korea with a 10 year-old public computer.

Since I was on the frontline, I had about 10-30 minutes to spare before my evening foot patrols. I used Codecademy to learn HTML and CSS. 

Then after 2 years of my mandatory military service, I came back to the United States to continue my college education.

I changed my then major (economics) to computer science. But it didn't go well.

I learned C++ in college. I hated the language itself, and the way class was taught. Some old professor who learned programming in the 70's or 80's taught my first class.

So I turned off my brain during that class and took some practical online courses. 

First, I got into Colt Steele's web bootcamp course on Udemy. So far, that is still the only online course I finished it 90%+. 

During my freshman and sophomore years, I took data structures (I was horrible at it and I didn't learn a thing). Then I took machine language courses (which I absolutely hated it). 

It's funny when I look back, it wasn't that I didn't like programming but the way my college taught me made me off. After all the boredom and ignoring all the signs that the academic CS wasn't for me, I finished my 2 years in community college and transfer to UC Berkeley. 

Yay! Life was great or so I thought.

At Berkeley, I encountered another challenge. 

Although I got accepted to Berkeley as a "computer science" major, they forgot to tell me that it was only "intended". 

In order to "properly" declare my major, I had to pass three CS courses with all B+ or above (if I remember correctly, I needed to maintain 3.4 GPA). 

Naively, I thought Berkeley CS was easy enough to declare a CS major. My first thought was: "Well I was a former ROK Marine served on the frontline. Pfff...a CS course? Give it to me.") 

After sleepless nights of struggling with math and probability concepts, I landed on "F". 

"An 'F'?" "Yes, not that F but actual F - WTF!" 

It was a CS70 (Theory of Computers) which I later negotiated with the instructor to boost it up to 'D' for "diligence". (Thanks to my mom's gene giving me skills of persuasion). Literally, I tried everything to get at least 'C-'. But I wasn't cut out for the course and the rigor of the CS program at Berkeley. 

Yeah I should've taken that summer off instead of taking the course. 

Yeah I should've taken CS61A (intro to CS in Python), etc. etc. 

In the end I failed. First time in my life. (At least academically speaking.) 

So what a failed CS "intended" major person could do at Berkeley? 

There seemed not too many options and mytime was running out. 

I was an international student who needed to worry about my job perspectives with immigration. So my choice narrowed down to a STEM-eligible major (you can stay up to 3 years instead of 1 year if you were a STEM student). See [here]('https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/optional-practical-training-extension-for-stem-students-stem-opt'). 


So I chose "Cognitive Science". Well, actually my major chose me. 

With sheer weird luck. I happened to love my major. 

I loved the aspect of flexibility in terms of what I could learn from psychology to sleep science to an intro course for AI. 

Also I took all these weird but interesting courses on Chinese philosophy, modern political thoughts from Machiavelli to Rousseau, etc. 

Heck, I met my girlfriend during my CogSci club activity ;)

My major in the end perfect choice for me. And I did so many things that I could have not imagined as a CS major at Berkeley from a sales internship to driking wine while taking ancient Greek philosophy classes. 

But here comes to an AI course in my last semester, after I got burnt out from the CS theory class, I stopped programming. I said, "Ok, I'm probably not cut-out for this thing called programming." 

Wrong.

At the moment, I didn't think this way. I was defeated so hard, like Napoleon's defeated soldier in Russia. 

Yes, to me academic CS courses were like Mother Russia: cold and bad mother fxxxer! 

Then my last semester, I had to finish my AI course, which I was afraid of. 

But it was required class to graduate. So I was like: "Okay I'll probably get another 'D'". 

Wrong. 

Fastfoward to the end of the course, I got 'A+'. 

In fact, that was the only class I got 'A+' from Berkeley. 

Isn't it ironic that I failed the CS theory course and got 'A+' from the AI course?

It gave me hope that I am not that bad at programming after all. 

In fact, I enjoyed the class since it was more practical than let's say "how can we use this binary tree to optimize run time? Anyone?" 

Yeah I am not that kind of "back end" guy. I'm the front end person. I love frontline where I could see what is going on whether on the battlefield or at work. I love the intensity and the fun of fast-moved paces. (Hey I'm Korean 빨리 빨리!) 

That's just how I was wired just like how my fellow classmates at Berkeley were wired. 

As I get older, I'm realizing I can do anything but not everything. I can do some backend (node JS and Python Django) if I put some time to learn. However, I can't be great at them like some crazy 100x programmers I saw at Berkeley and during my professional experiences in Silicon Valley. 

Now, it has been almost 2 years since I graduated from Berkeley. It's now time to start a new journey. 

After all that struggle and darkness I had to go through, thanks to Dr. Angela Yu and her team at London App Brewery, I'm re-polishing both my confidence and skills to leverage the 21st century's technology: programming.

In short, don't get discouraged by one academic CS course! 

You're a hacker. You're are a Marine--you make it happen! 

Then go make it happen. Oorah!
